## About The Project

This Game Engine is a basic ECS system that uses RAII concepts for memory management and the SFML graphics library as an easy start to get graphics up and running.

Current itaration only supports a single scene, a single Entity Manager and some very basic components such as Transform, Shape, Collision, Score, Lifespan, and Input.

A basic Geomerty Wars clone was implemented as a means of testing the concepts mentioned above.
